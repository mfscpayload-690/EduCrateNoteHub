## 🔒 Security

This application implements multiple security measures to protect users and data:

- ✅ **XSS Protection** - HTML escaping and removal of inline event handlers prevent script injection
- ✅ **Content Security Policy** - Strict CSP headers without unsafe-inline for scripts
- ⚠️ **Rate Limiting** - Basic rate limiting implemented (may need enhancement for production serverless environments)
- ✅ **Secure CORS** - Configurable cross-origin resource sharing
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Secure error messages that don't expose internal details

For detailed security information, see [SECURITY_AUDIT.md](SECURITY_AUDIT.md)
